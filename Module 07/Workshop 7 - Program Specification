    1. A count of the number of records written; 2. A grand total of all CD sales; 3. The average CD sale.
    • Utilize Numeric Edited Variable declarations. Your choice: $, Zero Suppression, Commas, etc.
2. Add the following code to the PROCEDURE DIVISION, after each FAVRPT-REC WRITE statement
    1. Add +1 to REC-KTR-OUT
    2. Add the calculated COST-CD to COST-TOTAL
3. At the end of the program (after all the input records have been read) display the following statistics:
    1. Number of records
    2. Gross Revenue (COST-TOTAL-OUT)
    3. Average CD Sale COST-TOTAL / Number of records

Workshop 8.1a 

You own a musical instrument shop which sells rock
band gear. You've been asked to respond to an RFP
(request for proposal) to outfit all the musicians in your
favorite rock band with instruments, amps, mics…"gear"

The costs for the various instruments are categorized by
instrument type and within type, instrument quality
Here is a record-layout you can use for RFP input file ?

Create a report program (FAVRFP) - that responds to the RFP input.
The report should consist of one detailed-line per valid input record:
• One/per RFP/Musician - showing the calculated costs with all commercial factors applied
(Instrument base-price, New/Used, Tax, Shipping, etc.).
• You can layout the output (report detailed-lines) as you see fit.
On the next slide are additional programming specifications, as well as a sample output record.

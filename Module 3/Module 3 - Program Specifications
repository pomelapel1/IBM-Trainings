Workshop 3.1b.  Create a new COBOL Program.

Potential record layout for FAVS. You will probably
have to modify field definitions and/or add fields
to FAV-REC to handle the program's requirements


Musical Group Name: 30 bytes Alpha-Numeric
Number of musicians in the band: 2 digits
Musical genre - 12 bytes:
CD cost - less than $1,000 - with two bytes to the right of the decimal place.
• Cost = CD + Shipping + Tax
TAX Calculation:
• If the CD-COST is > $40 the Tax is 6% of the CD-Cost
• Otherwise the Tax is 10% of the CD-Cost
Band is still together - 1 Byte: Valid values are: T/F 1 byte
Specifications for the report. The above non-COBOL requirements format
is similar to what you might get as part of a "spec package".
